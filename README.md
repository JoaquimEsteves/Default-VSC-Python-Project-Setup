# Default-VSC-Python-Project-Setup
Easy setup for python projects with visual studio code

## Mandatory Pip installs

```
python3 -m pip install mypy mypy-extensions autopep8 flake8 flake8-mypy
```

The `setup.cfg` should be dropped in your main project directory, and the settings.json should go into an
`.vsc` folder
